# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique. The goal is to group customers based on demographic and spending behavior, enabling businesses to better understand customer patterns and design targeted marketing strategies.

The project follows a clean, structured, and industry-oriented ML workflow, combining data preprocessing, clustering, evaluation, and visualization.

## 🧠 Model & Approach

- Unsupervised Machine Learning

- K-Means Clustering

- Feature encoding and scaling

- Optimal cluster selection using Elbow Method

- Cluster quality evaluation using Silhouette Score

## 🔹 Project Workflow 

- Loaded and explored the customer dataset

- Cleaned data and renamed columns for clarity

- Encoded categorical variables and selected relevant features

- Determined optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method

- Applied K-Means clustering to segment customers

- Assigned cluster labels and meaningful group names

- Visualized clusters for better interpretability

- Evaluated clustering performance using Silhouette Score
